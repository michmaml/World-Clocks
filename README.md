## World Clocks
Simple webiste made in my free time.
The idea originated when I moved to the Hong Kong for the very firt time and I thougth that I would facilitate the checking process. After that I added the option to choose out of 6 cities and possible user registration. 

## How to use the app
Once downloaded, run the script placed in the package.json **serverStart** and because nodemon is also installed there is no need to constantly restart the server.js.

Later, type: _localhost:5001_ in a browser.
Once the page loades it should be relatively clear to navigate.
